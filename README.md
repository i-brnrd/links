## Like a 'link in bio' for conferences

Make a site
  - copy the styles.css & index.html but change your links
  - set repo visibility to public
  - go to settings & switch on pages & you'll get a link

Install 
https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/ 

Then just type following in command line: 

<code>qr "https://YOUR-REPO-URL" > qr.png </code>

And it makes a QR code for your link.
